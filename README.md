## Usage

The package provides the `cmt` command with several powerful options:

### Basic Usage

```bash
    cmt # Start the interactive commit process
    cmt -s # Start commit process with file selection
    cmt -lc # Prefill the prompts from the last commit
    cmt -b # Run a build command first, then commit

```

The flags can be combined, for example `cmt -s -b -jr`.


## Configuration

The tool uses standard Git configuration and can be integrated with your existing Git workflow. For JIRA integration, ensure your credentials are properly configured.

## JIRA Integration

When using the `-jr` flag, Committer will:
1. Connect to your JIRA instance
2. Automatically fetch the issue title
3. Include the JIRA issue reference in your commit message

- 📝 Generates concise, professional commit messages
- 🔄 Integrates with JIRA summaries when available
- ✨ Follows commit message best practices

### Setup
